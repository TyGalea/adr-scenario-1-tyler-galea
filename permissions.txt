Context: Determining what permissions the mobile app will have access to.

Options Considered:
• Tracking users viewing and interactions with the app
• Location tracking
• Allowing push notifications

Decision:
The decision is made to require the permissions of tracking user interaction and
allowing push notifications when using the app.

Rationale
• Tracking user interaction will improve user experience by suggesting similar products
to the ones the user views the most.
• Push notifications will allow the app to alert the user of special offers and delivery status.

Consequences
• Requiring tracking of user interaction will lose users that are concerned about their privacy.
